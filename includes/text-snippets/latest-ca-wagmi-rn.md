## What is New?

---
 
This release of {{config.extra.arcana.ca_wagmi_sdk_name}} includes enhancements and bug fixes. Some APIs have changed.

- Supports unified balance and chain abstraction through [`sendTransactionAsync`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useSendTransaction#mutate-async) and [`writeContractAsync`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWriteContract#mutate-async) replacement functions.
- The `useBalance()` function is replaced by `useBalanceModal()`. See [usage details](https://docs.arcana.network/quick-start/ca-wagmi-quick-start/#usebalancemodal).
- New hook added:  `useBalance({ symbol: string })` to get the specified token balance across the supported chains.
- Added `transfer` and `bridge` functions to the hook `useCAFn()` for enabling chain abstracted functionality.
- Added checks to disable chain abstraction and allow regular behavior for wallet transactions if the user denies the sign in with Arcana at the start of the transaction.
- Other changes: UI enhancements, improved documentation. 

Check out the complete list of supported [[ca-stack#chains|chains]] and [[ca-stack#tokens|tokens]].
