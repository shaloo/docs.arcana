In {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}}'s chain abstraction protocol, solvers facilitate cross-chain transactions by supplying liquidity on the destination chain. After a user signs and authorizes an intent, a solver instantly provides the liquidity. In an optimal decentralized setup, multiple solvers compete to fulfill published intents.

The protocol periodically settles funds with solvers who have successfully completed user intents, using tokens from the supported source chains.
