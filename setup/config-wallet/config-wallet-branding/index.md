Wallet Customization

Manage the user experience for signing blockchain transactions by configuring SDK usage. Specify the [theme, branding](../../config-dApp-with-db/#settings-overview) settings of the in-app built-in Arcana wallet UI. Use [wallet visibility](../../../concepts/anwallet/walletvisibility/) and decide when to display the wallet UI in the app. Configure [keyspace](../../../concepts/keyspace-types/) and enable the user experience of having the same wallet address across multiple apps integrated with the Arcana Auth SDK.

You can also replace the built-in wallet UI with a [custom wallet UI](../../config-custom-wallet-ui/).
