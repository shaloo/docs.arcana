## What has Changed?

In this release there are **no usage changes** from the previous version of the SDK.

This new release includes support for Web3 gaming apps based on the Unity framework, support for MultiversX chain in the Arcana wallet, and minor bug fixes.

## How to Migrate to v1.0.10?

Install the latest Arcana Auth SDK v1.0.10. No integration code updates are required for the features in the previous release.

### MultiversX Support

If you wish to use this new release and add support for MultiversX in your app, there may be some changes related to the [configuration of MultiversX](../../setup/config-dApp-with-db-for-mvx/) as the default chain in the dashboard. Note that the [supported Web3 wallet operations for the MultiversX chain](../../auth/web3-ops/mvx/) are different from those for the EVM-compatible chains. See [MultiversX Quick Start Guide](../../quick-start/mvx-quick-start/) for more details.

That's all!
