## What has changed?

______________________________________________________________________

### Global Keys

This release wonâ€™t affect Web3 apps that rely on app-specific keys (default).

If the app developer selects [global keys](../../concepts/keyspace-types/) while configuring the app via the Arcana Developer Dashboard, the social auth settings for enabling the social login providers are **no longer** required.

Apps can choose to enable global keys on the Testnet as well as the Mainnet.

### New User Orientation

Earlier, when a user logged into the Web3 app integrated with the Arcana Auth SDK, the new user would instantly see the Arcana wallet in the app context. Now, a new orientation wizard pops up for the very first user login. Newcomers to Web3 or those unfamiliar with wallets can find value in the orientation wizard. Upon logging into the app, users can opt to skip it or swiftly get familiar with the layout of Arcana wallet, understanding where specific information is located.
