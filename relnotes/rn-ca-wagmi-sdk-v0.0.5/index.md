- Access a [unified balance](../../concepts/ca/unified-balance/) view through the [`useBalance`](https://ca-wagmi-sdk-ref-guide.netlify.app/#md:usebalance) hook
- Enable cross-chain functionality transparently with zero code changes within Web3 apps using the standard [`useSendTransaction`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useSendTransaction) and [`useWriteContract`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWriteContract) hooks

Check out the complete list of supported [chains and tokens](../../web3-stack/ca_stack/).
