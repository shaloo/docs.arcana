## What is New?

______________________________________________________________________

This is a major release of the Arcana CA Wagmi SDK with usage changes.

- **Installation change:** In addition to the `ca-wagmi` SDK, also install `ca-sdk`.
- **`CAProvider` change:** The `CAProvider` requires `client` and `network` (optional) params. Create a new `CA` object and specify it as the `client` parameter when creating the `CAProvider` component.
- **New hook:** Use [`useGetMyIntent(page))`](https://ca-wagmi-sdk-ref-guide.netlify.app/functions/usegetmyintents) to get a list of intents created in response to user's requests for funds.

Check out the complete list of supported [chains and tokens](../../web3-stack/ca_stack/).
