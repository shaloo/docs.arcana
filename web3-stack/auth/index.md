# Supported Auth Providers

To enable [social login](../../concepts/social-login/) and onboard users in Web3 apps, configure one or more of the supported authentication providers via the [Arcana Developer Dashboard](../../concepts/dashboard/).

## Social Login Providers

- Apple
- Cognito

## Custom Auth

Apps that use custom authentication (for example, Epic user authentication, Relative gaming user authentication mechanism) and require enabling authenticated users to sign blockchain transactions can use the [Custom Auth feature](../../concepts/authtype/custom-auth/).

## Passkeys

You can also use [passkeys](../../concepts/authtype/auth-passkeys/) to sign up and onboard users in Web3 apps built with the Arcana Auth SDK. Passkeys can be used as an alternate login mechanism or the only option to onboard an app.
