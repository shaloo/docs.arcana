# Supported Wallets

The Arcana Auth SDK works with third-party browser-based wallets as well as the built-in, non-custodial, in-app Arcana wallet.

The Arcana wallet is a built-in, in-app wallet accessible to authenticated users of Web3 apps integrated with Arcana Auth SDK.

### Built-in Wallet UI

Developers can choose to use the built-in Arcana wallet UI and quickly allow users to sign blockchain transactions via their app.

### Custom Wallet UI

When using the Arcana Auth SDK for user onboarding, by default the built-in, embedded, non-custodial Arcana wallet UI is enabled.

It is possible to totally replace the Arcana wallet UI with a [custom wallet UI](../../setup/config-custom-wallet-ui/).

Any browser-based wallet can be enabled in an app that is integrated with the Arcana Auth SDK. For example, MetaMask, Brave, Phantom, etc. Note that the wallet must work with the [supported chains](../chains/).
