# Arcana Gasless: Release Notes

{==

**Release Date: May 16, 2024**  

Gasless SDK Version: **v0.0.36**

This SDK extends the gasless transaction feature offered by the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} for {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} to third-party browser-based wallets. This standalone SDK does not depend on the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}. 

Use the [{{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}](https://dashboard.arcana.network/) to configure gas tanks, deposit funds, and whitelist app operations before integrating with the SDK.
