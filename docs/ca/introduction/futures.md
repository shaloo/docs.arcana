# Futures

## Arcana CA SDK

Today, developers can enable [[ca-top#unified-balance|unified balance]] in any dApp by integrating it with the Arcana [[concept-casdk|CA SDK]]. It supports unified balance across the following chains and tokens. We are actively working on adding support to enable unified balance across newer chains and tokens.

## Arcana CA Wallet (Standalone)

Besides the SDK, we have also [[ca-demo|demonstrated]] our **Chain Abstraction** technology through a standalone Arcana Wallet implementation ([download here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/arcana-wallet/nieddmedbnibfkfokcionggafcmcgkpi)). It allows [[ca-top#unified-balance|unified balance]] across the following chains and tokens. Only a few Web3 apps are supported at present. We are working on adding support for more apps in the Arcana CA wallet. Stay tuned!
