Integrate with the [[concept-casdk|{{config.extra.arcana.ca_sdk_name}}]].
Enable [[concept-unified-balance|unified-balance]] in {{page.meta.arcana.app_type}}
apps. Let the app users spend anywhere with chain abstracted transactions.

## 1. Install

{% include "./code-snippets/casdk_install.md" %}

## 2. Integrate

{% include "./text-snippets/quick-start-int-casdk.md" %}

## 3. Unified Balance

Get chain abstracted unified balance in the user's EOA.

{% include "./code-snippets/ca_get_ub.md" %}

## 4. CA Transaction

Web3 apps use the standard EIP-1193 provider to issue `request` 
call for transactions. To chain abstract these transactions, 
use `getEVMProviderWithCA`. It returns a CA enabled provider.

Replace the standard provider with the CA enabled one. This
enables chains abstraction for `eth_sendTransaction` operations via
`request` call.

{% include "./code-snippets/ca_get_req_prov.md" %}

## 5. Advanced

The SDK also provides functions to:

* View user intents
* Issue chain abstracted `bridge` and `transfer` functions
