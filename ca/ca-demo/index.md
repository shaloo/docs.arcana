# CA Demo

Here is our showcase demonstrating chain abstraction technology.

We use a two pronged approach for demo purposes:

1. Web3 Apps: Show CA in the context of popular Web3 apps by using a special CA enabled wallet.
1. SDK Demo: Show through a sample app integration how devs can enable chain abstracted transactions in any Web3 app by integrating the app with Arcana CA SDK.

## 1. Web3 Apps

In these videos, you'll see how unified balance and chain abstracted transactions elevate the user experience in some of these popular Web3 apps.

Note, these demo videos use the [Arcana CA Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/arcana-wallet/nieddmedbnibfkfokcionggafcmcgkpi) which is specially implemented to showcase the unified balance and chain abstracted transactions. It is not meant to be used as a full-fledged Web3 wallet, yet.

Click on the app specific tab to see chain abstracted transactions in action.

## 2. SDK Demo

Developers can integrate the Arcana CA SDK with any Web3 app to let users spend [unified balance](../../concepts/ca/unified-balance/) across chains via chain abstracted transactions.

Have a Web3 app?

*Have you integrated your app with our SDK?*

**We would be delighted to add your app integration demo here and share it with the larger Arcana [community](../../support/#arcana-community)!**
