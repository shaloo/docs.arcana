# Why CA SDK?

Arcana’s Chain Abstraction SDK can integrate with any Web3 app and enable unified balance for the app users. Unified balance allows users to spend the consolidated multi-chain balance of [supported source chain tokens](../../web3-stack/ca_stack/) within the app context on any destination chain.

This allows Web3 apps to onboard users from any ecosystem effortlessly. Integration with the SDK requires minimal effort.

## Onboard Users on Any Chain

- **Unified Balance**

  ______________________________________________________________________

  Display users' consolidated balance across chains. Use Arcana’s plug-and-play UI or design your own.

- **Larger Transactions**

  ______________________________________________________________________

  Users can seamlessly access and spend their entire multi-chain balance on the desired chain, in a single click.

- **No Lock-In**

  ______________________________________________________________________

## Quick Integration

- **Frontend Code Updates**

  ______________________________________________________________________

  Requires **minimal** changes to the Web3 app's front-end code.

- **No Smart Contract Changes**

  ______________________________________________________________________

  Requires **zero** migration or updates to Web3 app's smart contracts.

- **Bring Existing Wallets**

  ______________________________________________________________________

  Users can bring their existing EOA wallets such as MetaMask, Rabby, Rainbow, etc.

- **Assets: Zero Lockups or Transfers**

  ______________________________________________________________________

  Users do not need to transfer their funds to a new wallet address or lockup in a smart contract.

Arcana CA SDK Demo App: Unified Balance

## Why Chain Abstraction?

Chain abstraction addresses multiple blockchain usability issues. It eliminates liquidity fragmentation, enabling users to spend the available source chain unified balance on any destination chain. This offers a superior user experience by eliminating the need for users to navigate multiple blockchain hoops (bridges, token swaps, and determining the optimal route to consolidate funds acceptable on the destination chain). With unified balance, users can onboard a new chain with no assets or spend on a destination chain where the EOA has insufficient funds.

The table below illustrates how the user experience is superior with a single-click chain abstracted transaction.
