# IAM Providers: Custom Login UI

Developers can choose to **not** use Arcana's plug-and-play login UI for third-party IAM providers and instead build a custom login UI to onboard users.

In this case, developers must build the custom login UI themselves after configuring the IAM providers in the Arcana Developer Dashboard . This custom login UI must call appropriate user onboarding functions offered by the Arcana Auth SDK for the third-party IAM providers.
