# IAM Provider: Custom Login UI

Developers can choose to **not** use the plug-and-play login UI and instead build a custom login UI to onboard users.

In this case, developers must build custom login UI themselves after configuring the IAM Providers in the Arcana Developer Dashboard. This custom login UI must call appropriate user onboarding functions offered by the Arcana Auth SDK for every configured IAM provider.
