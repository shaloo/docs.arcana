Add/Update NFT

You can add, edit, and update NFT details. The NFT collection name appears automatically once the correct contract address is entered. The wallet address must match the NFT owner for manual addition to Arcana wallet.

NFT owners can delete NFTs, but only those manually added. Deleting an NFT removes it from the wallet but doesnâ€™t destroy it. You can re-add it if you still own it.

### Add NFT

Click **Manage** in the NFT tab of the wallet and select **New** to add an NFT. Provide requisite inputs and click **Save**.

Add NFT

### Modify NFT

To edit or delete a manually added NFT, go to the NFT wallet UI tab. Click **Manage** and select the NFT thumbnail to access the pen icon next to the NFT name. Click the pen to edit the details, or delete the NFT, and then click **Save**.
