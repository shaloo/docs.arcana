# Smart Contracts

The Arcana [Chain Abstraction(CA)](../../ca/chain-abstraction/) and Web3 authentication protocols are implemented through a bunch of smart contracts. These upgradeable contracts enforce protocol rules, ensure user data privacy, security and work with the Arcana Gateway for enabling [unified balance](../../ca/unified-balance/) and [social-login](../../social-login/) for Web3 authentication and wallet access control.

## Chain Abstraction

The Arcana chain abstraction feature is implemented through components built and deployed in the Cosmos ecosystem. In addition to those, it also implements smart contracts for Vault functionality on all supported chains.

## Web3 Authentication

Arcana Auth feature related smart contracts are implemented on the Polygon Network. These define and manage the logic and state of Web3 authentication for app users without storing any user credentials.
