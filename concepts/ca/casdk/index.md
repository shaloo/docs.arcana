# Arcana CA SDK

The Arcana CA SDK is meant for Web3 builders and app developers. It unifies the user balance in the wallet account spread across [chains and tokens](../../../web3-stack/ca_stack/).

Web3 app builders can integrate Arcana's [Chain Abstraction](../chain-abstraction/) feature via the SDK. Let users spend on any chain if they have sufficient funds across chains to cover for the transaction amount and the required gas fee.
