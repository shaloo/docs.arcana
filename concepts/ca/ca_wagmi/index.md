# Arcana CA Wagmi SDK

Arcana CA Wagmi SDK enables unified balance in Web3 apps using the [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) framework. The SDK offers a plug-and-play widget that display the unified balance for the app users and helps them transact on any chain.

Web3 Wagmi app builders can integrate the Arcana's [Chain Abstraction](../chain-abstraction/) feature via the SDK and let users spend on any chain, as long as they have sufficient funds across chains to cover for the transaction amount and the required gas fee.
