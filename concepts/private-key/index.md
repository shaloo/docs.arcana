# Private Key

A private key is a secret linked to the user's Arcana wallet. It is generated by the asynchronous distributed key generator ([ADKG](../adkg/)) component of the protocol used by the Arcana Auth SDK. [Only the user can access it](../../faq/faq-auth/#user-key-privacy).

Users can export their private key securely via the Arcana wallet UI. The user is responsible for securing the exported key.
