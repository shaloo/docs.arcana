# Arcana Auth SDK

Arcana Auth SDK streamlines user onboarding in Web3 apps with an embedded, non-custodial wallet for secure blockchain transactions.

Developers start by [registering the app](../../setup/config-auth/register-app/) and [configuring auth settings](../../setup/config-auth/) through the [Arcana Developer Dashboard](../dashboard/). Each registered app gets a unique **Client ID** essential for integrating with the Arcana Auth SDK.

## Download

Multiple flavors of the Arcana Auth SDK are available for different types of Web3 apps such as web, mobile and gaming. See [Auth SDK installation section](../../auth/sdk-installation/) for details.
