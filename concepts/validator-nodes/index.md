# Validator Nodes

Validator nodes play a crucial role in ensuring the decentralization of the Arcana blockchain protocol components used in securely generating user's [private key](../private-key/) for signing blockchain transactions. These partner infrastructure nodes participate in the distributed key generation process([ADKG](../adkg/)), that generates key shares (not the key itself) for users. The private key is only created within the authenticated user's context in the app.

At the launch of the Mainnet, some nodes in the DKG subsystem are owned and operated by Arcana, while the remaining nodes are owned and run by trusted partners. In the future, other third parties will be allowed to participate in the key generation protocol.

For more information on the latest implementation of asynchronous distributed key generation (ADKG), consult the see [Arcana Technical Whitepaper](https://www.notion.so/Arcana-Technical-Docs-a1d7fd0d2970452586c693e4fee14d08).
