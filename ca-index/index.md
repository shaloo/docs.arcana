# Unify Balance Across Chains

Let users spend any supported crypto asset on [any blockchain](../web3-stack/ca_stack/) instantly - no chain switching, no bridging, no cross-chain swaps necessary.

Build seamless, no hassle Web3 transaction experience.

Integrate Web3 app with the Arcana's [Chain Abstraction](../concepts/ca/chain-abstraction/) (CA) SDK. Enable app users to access and spend the [unified balance](../concepts/ca/unified-balance/) combining assets from all chains.

**TL;DR** | [Install](../ca/ca-sdk-installation/) | [Quick Start](#quick-start) | [Examples](../ca/examples/) | [Usage](../ca/ca-usage-guide/)

## Quick Start

What kind of Web3 app do you have?

Select the appropriate app type and get started with integrating the [Arcana CA SDK](../concepts/ca/casdk/).

[Web Apps](../quick-start/ca-quick-start/) [Wagmi Apps](../quick-start/ca-wagmi-quick-start/)

Advanced Usage

Let users onboard Web3 apps via [social login](../concepts/social-login/). Let them spend [unified balance](../concepts/ca/unified-balance/) on any chain through [chain abstracted transactions](../concepts/ca/chain-abstraction/). For this, the app must be [integrated with **both** the SDKs](../quick-start/auth-ca-wagmi-quick-start/), Arcana CA SDK and the Arcana Auth SDK.

## Spend on Any Chain

Chain abstracted transactions are a game changer for Web3 app adoption. Integrate with Arcana CA SDK to enable unified balance in Web3 apps.

- **Unified Balance**

  ______________________________________________________________________

  Spend on any chain with unified balance of funds on the source chains and sign transactions on any destination chain with a third-party browser-based wallet.
